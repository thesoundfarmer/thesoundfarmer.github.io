<p>I offer location sound recording services for almost any style of production.  
  With almost 10 years experience in the field of location sound and six in outside broadcast engineering, I have a range of 
  technical skills and equipment at my disposal.  As well as being reasonably friendly to work with, my main aim in life is to make any shoot go as smoothly as possible and I'm a strong believer in working as a team to do so.
<p>I have a particular interest in natural history and 
consider myself to be a "general wildlife enthusiast".  I've worked on various productions for the BBC Natural History Unit including Springwatch, Autumnwatch and Winterwatch 
as well as wildlife themed shoots for the One Show.  My inventory has a range of hydrophones, contact mics and parabolic reflectors specifically for wildlife sound recording.</p>
